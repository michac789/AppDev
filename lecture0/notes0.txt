CS50 App Lecture 0: Overview, Javascript

+++ Javascript Basics +++
- Javascript is interpreted, each browser has its own Javascript engine
- Basics (see 0-syntax.js)
- Primitive types: undefined, null, boolean, number, string, (symbol) // Objects
- Primitives are immutable, objects are mutable and stored by reference
- Explicit(ex: String()) vs Implicit coercion(ex: x+"")
- '==' coerces the type, '===' does not coerce the type / strict equality
- Passing by reference vs value, use Object.assign({}, obj) for deepcopy
- Prototypal inheritance
- Scoping (lexically, var; block scoped, let & const)
- Javascript engine: 1st phase (reads and throws syntax error, any function definitions
stored in memory; lexically scoped variable will be hoisted)
- Functions not stored in variable are hoisted in javascript
