CS50 App Lecture 1: Javascript, ES6

- Transpilers (Babel, Typescript, CoffeeScript, etc.)
- Closures (function that refer to variable declared by parents)
- Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
- Javascript is a single-threaded, synchronous language, but there are functions that
run asynchronously (ex: setTimeOut function)
- Asynchronous Javascript: execution stack, browser APIs, function queue, event loop
